## About Me
Hello, I’m Chintan Rout, a senior ECE undergrad from MIT Manipal, India. I’m going to soon start my work as a GCRS: Data Analyst Intern at KPMG. 

I am deeply passionate about data and the infinite potential it holds. I keep seeking opportunities where I can improve and utilize my Analytical, Mathematical and Visualization skills to solve real life problems related to analyzing a big volume of datasets to draw insights that can help with decision making. Projects that involve Machine Learning are the ones that catch my attention and hopefully with time I will continue to pursue more complex projects and keep improving on my current models.

I also started a small blogging page where I continously update new topics that I cover or courses I start. It is also a way for me to keep track of all the new topics I come across while working on a new projects.
